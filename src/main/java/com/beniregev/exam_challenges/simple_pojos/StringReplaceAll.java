 *             <p>
 *                 Most of you might have got the answer correct. For those who did not get it, It's a
 *                 code that will print {@code Java Challenge} 1000 times without using any loop/recursion
 *                 but {@code replaceAll} method is using loop only internally. If we count the total number
 *                 of execution here, it will be â€”
 *             </p>
 *             <pre>
 *                 <code>
 *             first replace statement - 1
 *             second replace statement - 10
 *             third replace statement - 100
 *             fourth replace statement - 1000
 *                 </code>
 *             </pre>
 *             <p>
 *                 So the counter count is 1111 in this case but if you try to print anything 1000 times
 *                 with any loop so that will have 1000 counters only.
 *             </p>
 *             <p>
 *                 Thanks. Let me know if you know any other way to print anything 1000 times without
 *                 using a loop/recursion.
